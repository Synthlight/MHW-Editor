need someone further testing param 9 unk145 + 150
150 time delay for the red line appear when you strike down if value >1 will make it disappear i dont know if it affect anything other than that
149time delay for your helm hit and contact monster body .
This unk make me confuse if edit it value > 1 it can slow down helm breaker may make it hit less hit or remove it completely
But if you lower value than it default you can make it hit faster and can hit more than helm breaker hit limit depend how low you edit
(149 > 150 hit appear before red line 150 > 149 hit appear after red line)
dunno if unk 149 effect like pierce ammo effect but affect by monster height

    Ratipone:
        Under Atk1, Unk 16 and 19 determine the speed at which the attack animation continues to play at slowmo during the hitstop.
        For example:
        Most regular attacks have this value at 0 therefore they come to a full stop during hitstop
        But heavier attacks like Greatsword's Strong Charge, True Charge, and Jumping Wide Slash have these values at 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05
